### Description

WebDevAuthn is a web tool to test & analyze FIDO2/WebAuthn requests and responses. The web application can work as a playground, letting developers experiment and understannd with the WebAuthn internals, while also allowing the testing and experimentation of FIDO2 authenticator devices.

Furthermore, developers may use this tool's injector (in the form of embedded code or an extension) to hijack WebAuthn calls and analyse them. The tool also features an advance virtual authenticator, able to emulate WebAuthn responces.

The tool allows developers to:
 - experiment through a WebAuthn playground;
 - validate the information passed to the authentication by the FIDO2/WebAuthn server as parameters;
 - decode and analyse the authenticatorâ€™s WebAuthn response;
 - use the embedded virtual FIDO2 authenticator;
 - test webauthn implementations;
 - assess the security of a WebAuthn implementation;
